# PacMan AI Project
 
## Overview of Pacman project:
This project is based on the **UC Berkeley CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** Pac-Man projects.  
The goal is to implement various **search algorithms** to control Pac-Man in different maze environments.  
 
## Features:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- ** A* Search (UCS)**
  
- Works with different **maze layouts**:
  - `tinyMaze`
  - `mediumMaze`
  - `bigMaze`
- Designed for learning AI concepts like **search, heuristics, and problem-solving**.
 
### Installation steps followed:
1. Clone the repository from "https://github.com/jspacco/pac3man". Used fork to make a copy the project to my GIT REPO
2. After creating the repo, Git was cloned cloned from https://github.com/ravi-ariyagounder/pacman.AI to my local drive
